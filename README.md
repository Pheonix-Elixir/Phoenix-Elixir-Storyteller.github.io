👋 Hi, I’m @Pheonix-Elixir

🌱 I’m currently learning how to make a website so that I can make a reading writing website that both monetizes writers and alows them to interact with their communit.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this project with those who are like minded, I want this to be a website that helps writers monetize their passions.
